# BreastCancerDetection

## Engineering thesis

A computer application that identifies breast cancer in indicated images using deep convolutional networks.

A CNN algorithm was designed and implemented to classify breast cancer
on histopathological images. In order to use the algorithm by end users, an application with
a graphical user interface was created for intuitive operation of photo processing. Breast
cancer is the most common cancer in women and is often fatal, but if diagnosed early
enough, it can be completely cured. One way of diagnosis is histopathology, which provides
pictures taken from a microscope. Thanks to the development of artificial intelligence, it
is possible to detect objects in images, including breast cancer cells in histopathological
images. Convolutional networks have been created especially for this purpose, which can
efficiently analyze and select graphical features. The document includes a description of the
workflow for deep learning of the convolutional network resnet18, implementation of the
algorithm in order for the network to process user images, testing the learning parameters
and the created GUI, and instructions for using the graphical user interface. Finally, options
for the development of the application and conclusions of the work carried out are presented.
